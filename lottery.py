"""
How to start a lottery.
1. Get an array by decoding every address, and sum it.
2. Iterate the list, repeat step 1, generate an list that has the sum of every valid address.
3. Find the min and max from the list that generated from step 2, taking both as lowebound and upperbound.
4. Generate a random number between the min and the max, find out who is nearest to this random number(and bigger than random number), this address is the winner.
5. Repeat 5 times to get 5 winners.
